# Tiles Boilerplate Code

This code is meant to be shared among [Tiles](http://tilestoolkit.io)-related projects. 

Based on the code created by Theo Hyvon for the [Anyboard](http://anyboardgames.co) project 

I reccommend to use Microsoft Visual Studio Code with Arduino plugin as IDE

The code is released under Apache 2.0 license.

## Setup
* Install Arduino
* Install RFDUINO package for Arduino
* Copy the content of /libraries into Arduino library folder
* Install Ms Visual Studio Code + Arduino plugin (optional) 
* Upload the code (boilerplate.ino) to a RFDUINO board 

## Data Primitives

This code allows you to exchange data via BLE with a set of sensors and actuator connected to a RFDUINO board. Data is packaged in so-called *data primitives*, composed by the name of the primitive plus two optional parameters. 

A data primitive is exchanged between RFDUINO and a BLE Client using UTF-8 comma-separated strings; e.g. *primitive_name[,parameter1][,parameter2]*  

A data primtive containing an event triggered from a sensor (e.g. accelerometer) is called *input primitive*; e.g. *"tap,single"*. A data primitive containing a command send to an actuator (e.g. motor) is called *output primitive*; e.g. *"led,blink,red"*.

## List of sensors and actuators
These are the electronic parts for which data primitives are available

### Input
* ADXL345 Accelerometer
* LSM9DS0 IMU
* CAP1188 Touch Sensor
* Momentary pushbutton (soon)

### Output
* RGB LED, common anode or common catode
* NeoPixel LEDs
* 8X8 Dot Matrix based on HT16K33
* Vibration motor driven by analogic circuit
* Vibration motor driven by DRV2605 IC (soon)
